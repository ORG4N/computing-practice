First year Computer Science Project (COMP1004)

With a mission to satiate their customer’s appetite and provide a high quality dine-in environment Doki-Doki Delight envisions a future in which their small café can become a ‘safe space’ for their community. However, their unreliable and outdated paper-based reservation system has caused may inaccuracies and at times conflicts with their friendly motives. Implementing a web-based café management system will embellish Doki-Doki Delight’s mission and enable it to become modernised. 

Digitalisation of a management system will allow the primary stakeholders (managers and staff) to carry out their responsibilities effectively. The system will introduce benefits such as: the potential of accidental errors being limited and therefore an increase of accuracy; improved conveniency through a greater ease of access to the system – data can be easily amended or deleted; and finally, the Track and Trace implementations will provide a sense of security to the stakeholders – they can feel safe knowing that pandemic measures are in place. Overall, Doki-Doki Delight will be better equipped to serve their community.
